## What is it?
frame_postprocess is an open-source python package that facilitates the postprocessing of seismic nonlinear response history analyses (NLRHA) of 2D OpenSees models of moment frames.
    
frame_postprocess was the main post-processing tool in following publications:  
  
- *Galvis, F. A. (2022). “Seismic Risk and Post-Earthquake Recovery of Older Tall Buidings with Welded Steel Moment Frames.”Ph.D. thesis. John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center, Stanford University.*
  
- *Galvis, F. A., Deierlein, G. G., Yen, W., and Molina Hutt, C., Correal J. F., (2022). Detailed Database of Tall Pre-Northridge Steel Moment Frames for Earthquake Performance Evaluations. (In review).*
  
- *Galvis, F. A., Deierlein, G. G., Zsarnoczay3, A., and Molina Hutt, C., (2022). Seismic screening method for tall pre-Northridge welded steel moment frames based on the collapse risk of a realistic portfolio. (In preparation).*

## Main features
### Plotting frame elevations  
The package is capable of plotting 2D frames with any of the following configurations:
  
The reponse of beam hinges, column hinges, splices, and panel zones can be presented as shown in Figure 1. For welded steel moment frames, the package treats the connection damage index (see SteelFractureDI material in OpenSees) as an engineering demand parameter (EDPs).

### Plotting EDP responses
The EDPs can be easily plotted in height overlaying relevant statistics for collapse and non-collapse simulations as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

### Calculating fragility curver from multi-stripe analysis 
frame_postprocess also includes functions to compute and plot the collapse fragility function of a structure from the results of a multi-stripe analysis (Figure 4).

## Examples

A Juyter notebook that generates the figures shown above for one building is included to demostrate the use of the package.
